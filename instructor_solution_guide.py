# 1. Dataset Preparation
# ===============================
"""
Dataset Name:
    thermal_classification_cropped

Description:
    The dataset contains thermal images divided into two categories:
        - ICAS (patients with internal carotid artery stenosis)
        - Non-ICAS (normal cases)

Total Number of Images:
    950 samples

Dataset Split:
    - Train: 70%
    - Validation: 15%
    - Test: 15%

Data Augmentation (Training Only):
    - Resize (224x224)
    - Random Horizontal Flip
    - Random Rotation (±15 degrees)
    - Color Jitter (brightness, contrast, saturation)
    - Random Affine Transform
    - Normalization (mean/std of ImageNet)

Validation Transform:
    - Resize (224x224)
    - Normalization (same as training)

# 2. Model Architecture (ResNet18 Transfer Learning)
# ===============================
"""
Base Model:
    ResNet18 (pretrained on ImageNet)

Modifications:
    - First 10 convolutional layers frozen (to retain pretrained features)
    - Final fully connected (fc) layer replaced with:
        nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(512, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.3),
            nn.Linear(128, 2)
        )

Reason:
    To adapt ResNet18 to a binary classification problem (ICAS vs Non-ICAS).

Computation Device:
    CUDA (GPU) used when available, otherwise CPU.

# ===============================
# 3. Training Configuration
# ===============================
"""
Loss Function:
    CrossEntropyLoss

Optimizer:
    Adam (learning rate = 0.001)

Learning Rate Scheduler:
    StepLR(step_size=5, gamma=0.5)

Training Setup:
    - Epochs: 20
    - Batch Size: 32
    - Optimizer zeroed per iteration
    - Validation loss and accuracy computed after each epoch
"""

# ===============================
# 4. Evaluation Metrics and Results
# ===============================
"""
Performance Metrics:
    Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC

Test Results:
    Accuracy: 61.54%
    Precision: 0.669
    Recall: 0.856
    F1-score: 0.751
    AUC: 0.522

Interpretation:
    - High Recall (0.85) → The model successfully detects most ICAS cases.
    - Moderate Precision (0.66) → Some false positives exist.
    - F1-score shows balance between precision and recall.

"""

# ===============================
# 6. Conclusion and Future Work
# ===============================
"""
Summary:
    The ResNet18 model achieved around 61% accuracy with a high recall,
    meaning it effectively identifies ICAS cases but sometimes confuses normal samples.
    Despite moderate performance, the model demonstrates that transfer learning
    on limited medical thermal data can achieve meaningful results.

Possible Improvements:
    - Fine-tune more layers of ResNet18.
    - Use higher-resolution inputs or ResNet50/101 for deeper features.
    - Apply better data augmentation or balance dataset classes.
    - Increase dataset size to improve generalization.
